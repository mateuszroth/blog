# General notes
## Hints
* treat components like pure functions and don't modify props

# Terms

## Prop drilling

Passing props through a component tree, not a good pattern in most cases:

## Context

Context is a way to essentially create global variables that can be passed around in a React app so no prop drilling would be needed.

Context is often touted as a **simpler, lighter solution to using Redux** for state management.

# Testing
## Snapshot testing

* To make our tests really useful, we should run them before each commit. So we can be sure, that we didnâ€™t break anything accidentally. For example [_<em>husky_</em>](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) package can help to setup and run pre-commit hooks.
* The snapshot tests become really powerful when you are working on larger application or multiple developers are working on the same codebase.
* Life examples when snapshot tests fail are available here in the section "Typical regressions": [https://medium.com/simply/snapshots-painless-testing-of-react-components-6bce3c4d51fc](https://medium.com/simply/snapshots-painless-testing-of-react-components-6bce3c4d51fc)
