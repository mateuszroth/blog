# Styled Components

## Pros of

*   **styles are part of JavaScript** (CSS-in-JS) in this case and allow you to build components from CSS snippets
*   with styled components **you can build CSS dynamically based on props and state of the component**
*   **you don't have to create tons of class names** with related CSS declarations written somewhere else. Class names are generated automatically and you donâ€™t have to care about them anymore.
