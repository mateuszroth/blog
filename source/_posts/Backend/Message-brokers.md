# Message brokers
* a message broker accepts and forwards messages
* allows applications to communicate via a queuing mechanism
* a program that sends messages is a *producer*
* a *queue* is essentially a large message buffer
* many *producers* can send messages that go to one *queue*, and many *consumers* can try to receive data from one *queue*
* a *consumer* is a program that mostly waits to receive messages

## Use cases
* Point-to-point messaging
* Publish/subscribe - event-driven architecture-based system, where applications have fewer dependencies between each other
* Long-running tasks and crucial API like preparing files to download
* Microservices - to create event-based communication and use the message broker together with publish/subscribe pattern instead of REST APIs
* Transactional systems - where we have several actions that need to be made after each previous one completes

## Advantages
* Improved system performance by introducing asynchronous processing
* Increased reliability by guaranteeing the transmission of messages
  * In case of consumer failure, it can redeliver the message immediately or after some specified time

## Disadvantages
* Increased system complexity
  * maintaining the network between components or security issues
  * problem related to eventual consistency where some components could not have up-to-date data until the messages are propagated and processed
* Debugging can be harder
* Thereâ€™s a steep learning curve at first
  * size of queues and messages, the behavior of queues, delivery settings or messages TTL

## Amazon SQS & SNS
* you can combine Amazon SNS power of publishing to multiple recipients with Amazon SQS durable queues
